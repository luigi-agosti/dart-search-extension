All the code has been developed and tested during the London Dart Hackathon 2012.

The general idea was to use as much as possible dart code for the extension and use javascript only for the interface layer to chrome.

The dart part can be found in the Android Boriero repository :

We are happy to receive feedback, changes or see the code used for other open source projects.
